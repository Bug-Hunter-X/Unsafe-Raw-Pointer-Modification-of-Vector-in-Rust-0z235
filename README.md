This repository contains a Rust program that demonstrates a potential issue when using raw pointers to modify a vector. The `bug.rs` file shows the original code, and `bugSolution.rs` demonstrates the safe and idiomatic approach to modify vector elements.  The unsafe code provides a potential for undefined behavior because it bypasses Rust's memory safety guarantees. The solution promotes safe and maintainable Rust practices.
